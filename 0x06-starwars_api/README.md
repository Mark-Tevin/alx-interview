# The “0. Star Wars Characters” project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an arguments.
# several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript are used here

## Concepts 
# Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js.
# Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
# Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.
# Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
# Handling API response data asynchronously.
# Using the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.
# Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures to format and display character names.
